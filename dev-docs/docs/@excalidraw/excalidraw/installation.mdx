### Static assets

Excalidraw depends on assets such as localization files (if you opt to use them), fonts, and others.

By default these assets are loaded from a public CDN [`https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist/`](https://unpkg.com/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist), so you don't need to do anything on your end.

However, if you want to host these files yourself, you can find them in your `node_modules/@excalidraw/excalidraw/dist` directory, in folders `excalidraw-assets` (for production) and `excalidraw-assets-dev` (for development).

**Copy** these folders to your static assets directory, and add a `window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` variable in your `index.html`, before any `@excalidraw/excalidraw` import.

For example, if you serve your assets from the root of your CDN, you would do:

```js
// Vanilla
<head>
    <script>
        window.EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH = "https://my.cdn.com/assets/";
    </script>    
</head>
```

or if you prefer the path to be dynamicly set based on the `window.origin`, you could do the following:

```jsx
// Next.js
<Script id="load-env-variables" strategy="beforeInteractive" >
    { `window["EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH"] = window.origin;` }
</Script>
```

### Dimensions of Excalidraw

Excalidraw takes _100%_ of `width` and `height` of the containing block so make sure the container in which you render Excalidraw has non zero dimensions.
